# Normative Layer  
## Goal Selection, Value Constraints, and Legitimacy Above Execution

---

## Status

This document defines the **Normative Layer** of the stack.

It assumes:

- `0_core/execution_primitives.md`
- `1_structural/typing_discipline.md`
- `2_control/control_layer.md`
- `3_cognitive/cognitive_layer.md`
- `4_domain/*`

This layer does **not** override physics.  
It does **not** override topology.  
It does **not** override viability.

It defines:

> How goals, values, legitimacy, and meaning become binding constraints  
> **without pretending to be physics.**

If:

- Execution defines what must be true to run,
- Control defines how to remain stable,
- Cognition defines how to choose under infinity,
- Domain layers instantiate structure,

then the Normative Layer defines:

> What is chosen to be optimized, protected, prohibited, or preserved.

---

# 1. Scope

This layer applies when:

- agents select goals,
- trade-offs are evaluated,
- prohibitions are declared,
- legitimacy is claimed,
- commitments are made binding.

It includes:

- ethics,
- institutional norms,
- personal values,
- constitutional rules,
- mission statements,
- declared priorities.

It does not assume moral realism.
It does not assume universal agreement.

It assumes only:

> Goals constrain action space.

---

# 2. Norms as Constraints, Not Explanations

A norm is a constraint on admissible action.

It does not describe the world.
It restricts reachable states.

Examples:

- “Do not violate safety invariant.”
- “Truth over prestige.”
- “Never use force except under X.”
- “Health before achievement.”

Norms are upstream filters on control and cognition.

They operate at the closure boundary.

---

# 3. The Two Directions of Constraint

There are two structurally distinct constraint directions:

## 3.1 Physics-Up (Non-Negotiable)

From Execution Layer:

- bounded resources,
- irreversibility,
- topology,
- drift,
- viability.

These constrain what is possible.

They are descriptive.

---

## 3.2 Goal-Down (Chosen)

From Normative Layer:

- declared values,
- mission selection,
- prohibited actions,
- acceptable trade-offs,
- identity commitments.

These constrain what is permitted.

They are selected.

---

# 4. Norms as Additional Constraint Sets

Normative constraints are:

- extra conditions on admissible actions,
- not replacements for physical constraints.

They reduce degrees of freedom.

Example:

Physics allows deception.
Normative layer may prohibit it.

Physics allows self-sacrifice.
Normative layer may forbid reckless collapse.

Norms define:

> Which physically possible paths are declared inadmissible.

---

# 5. Legitimacy

Legitimacy is:

> Acceptance of a normative constraint set by relevant loci in topology.

Legitimacy requires:

- substitutability,
- explicitness,
- declared enforcement,
- bounded horizon.

Illegitimate norms:

- lack topology support,
- depend only on narrative,
- impose load without declared authority.

Norms must survive executability to coordinate.

---

# 6. Normative Closure

Norms become binding only when:

- embedded in executable structures,
- admitted into contracts,
- enforced through control,
- integrated into decision boundaries.

Otherwise they remain narrative preferences.

A value that never crosses the executability boundary is interpretive only.

---

# 7. Horizon Sensitivity of Norms

Norms are horizon-bound.

Short-horizon norms:

- maximize immediate welfare,
- reduce discomfort,
- minimize conflict.

Long-horizon norms:

- preserve viability,
- protect redesign capacity,
- guard against tail risk.

Horizon mismatch causes:

- moral incoherence,
- institutional instability,
- personal burnout.

Norms must declare horizon scope.

---

# 8. Trade-Off Surfaces

Norms define trade-off surfaces between:

- truth and harmony,
- autonomy and safety,
- efficiency and redundancy,
- loyalty and fairness,
- exploration and stability.

These trade-offs cannot be removed.

They can only be:

- declared,
- prioritized,
- versioned.

Hidden trade-offs produce invisible load.

---

# 9. Versioning of Normative Systems

Normative systems drift.

To remain redesign-safe:

- norms must be versioned,
- enforcement scope must be declared,
- redesign authority must be explicit.

Unversioned norms harden into:

- dogma,
- silent coercion,
- frozen topology.

Versioning preserves adaptability.

---

# 10. Normative Failure Modes

## 10.1 Moralizing Physics

Declaring that physical constraints are unjust.

Example:
- “We should not need sleep.”

This is ill-typed.

---

## 10.2 Narrative-Only Norms

Declaring values without enforcement or structural embedding.

Result:
- signaling without constraint.

---

## 10.3 Over-Constraining Upstream

Adding normative constraints that:

- reduce viability,
- eliminate redesign capacity,
- suppress refusal symmetry.

Norms must not violate execution primitives.

---

## 10.4 Under-Constraining

Failing to declare prohibitions leads to:

- hidden coercion,
- silent load displacement,
- emergent illegitimacy.

---

# 11. Norms and Power

Power determines:

- who sets norms,
- who enforces norms,
- who bears normative load,
- who controls redesign authority.

Normative authority without load exposure is unstable.

Norms that assign cost asymmetrically without topology awareness will collapse.

---

# 12. Personal Normative Layer

In the personal domain:

Norms include:

- “Truth before comfort.”
- “Health before status.”
- “Refusal symmetry is non-negotiable.”
- “Do not trade long-horizon viability for short validation.”

These reduce reachable states.

They increase friction.

They may reduce social access.

But they stabilize long-horizon coherence.

Norms must still pass viability.

---

# 13. Robotics Normative Layer

In robotics:

Norms include:

- safety invariants,
- fail-safe requirements,
- transparency mandates,
- regulatory compliance.

These constrain design space.

They may reduce performance.

They increase legitimacy and survivability.

---

# 14. Separation from Optimization

Optimization operates within normative constraints.

Norms define objective admissibility.
Optimization improves within admissible region.

Optimization cannot determine norms.

Norms cannot violate physics.

---

# 15. What This Layer Is Not

It is not:

- a moral doctrine,
- a universal ethics,
- a political manifesto.

It is a structural description of how values become constraints.

It clarifies:

- where values enter,
- how they bind,
- how they fail,
- how they drift.

---

# Summary

The Normative Layer:

- selects which paths are admissible,
- constrains action space beyond physics,
- declares trade-offs,
- binds goals into execution,
- requires topology for legitimacy,
- must respect viability and drift.

Physics defines what is possible.
Norms define what is permitted.
Control keeps it stable.
Cognition chooses paths.
Execution makes it real.

Everything must type-check.
