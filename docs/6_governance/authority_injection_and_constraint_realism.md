# Authority Injection and Constraint Realism

## Narrative Override as a Governance Failure Mode

---

## Status

This document defines a structural failure mode that arises in bounded execution systems when:

* Authority claims are detached from load exposure.
* Constraint primitives are subordinated to narrative.
* Ontological hierarchy is inverted.

It assumes:

* Execution Primitives (E1–E8)
* Structural Typing Discipline
* Normative Layer
* Governance Layer

It introduces no new primitives.

It specifies a corruption pattern that invalidates stack coherence without violating physical law directly.

# 1. Constraint Realism

Constraint Realism asserts:

1. Physical and informational constraints exist independently of narrative.
2. Authority is downstream of constraint exposure.
3. Norms restrict admissible trajectories but cannot modify primitives.
4. Governance operates on constraints but cannot suspend primitives.
5. Consequences propagate regardless of interpretation.

Formally:

Let:

$$
\Omega_H
$$

be the set of physically possible trajectories under E1–E8.

Then:

Narrative function:

$$
\mathcal{N} : \Omega_H \rightarrow \text{Interpretations}
$$

does not modify:

$$
\Omega_H
$$

Interpretation is downstream from constraint.

---

# 2. Narrative Primacy Inversion

Narrative Primacy occurs when:

Interpretation is treated as upstream of constraint.

Formally, when system behavior assumes:

$$
\Omega_H = f(\mathcal{N})
$$

instead of:

$$
\mathcal{N} = f(\Omega_H)
$$

This inversion introduces structural incoherence.

# 3. Authority Injection

Authority Injection is defined as:

> The claim that admissibility, constraint validity, or consequence interpretation derives from status, narrative, or declared authority rather than from measurable structure and load exposure.

It occurs when an actor claims:

1. Interpretive control over invariant structure.
2. Legitimacy detached from enforcement topology.
3. Stability credit without load-bearing contribution.
4. Constraint exemption via narrative framing.
5. Reinterpretation of failure as narrative misclassification.

Authority Injection does not modify primitives.
It modifies discourse about primitives.

---

# 4. Structural Symptoms

Authority Injection manifests as:

## 4.1 Constraint Denial

* Claiming a wall does not exist despite impact.
* Treating physical invariants as optional.
* Substituting magical or exceptional explanations for measurable failure.

## 4.2 Post-Hoc Narrative Rewriting

* Failure attributed to luck or incompetence rather than constraint breach.
* Success attributed to authority rather than structural compatibility.

## 4.3 Authority Without Load Exposure

* Claiming ownership of stable systems without bearing reinforcement cost.
* Declaring constraints binding without absorbing enforcement burden.

## 4.4 Ontological Drift

* Treating primitives as negotiable.
* Elevating normative declaration above execution primitives.
* Allowing governance to redefine invariant structure.

# 5. Why Authority Injection Is Destabilizing

Authority Injection produces:

1. Metric corruption (metrics optimized symbolically).
2. Drift blindness (parameter shifts reinterpreted narratively).
3. Governance misalignment (authority detached from resource floors).
4. Responsibility distortion (load not traceable).
5. Redesign paralysis (failure not recognized structurally).

It does not prevent physical failure.

It delays recognition of constraint violation.

# 6. Separation from Legitimate Governance

Legitimate governance:

* Modifies admissible sets.
* Declares enforcement pathways.
* Bears load exposure.
* Versions constraint updates.

Authority Injection:

* Claims modification of primitives.
* Avoids load exposure.
* Suppresses failure signals.
* Relies on interpretive dominance.

The distinction is structural, not moral.

---

# 7. Interaction with Typing Discipline

A claim exhibiting Authority Injection is:

* Ill-Typed if it contradicts E1–E8.
* Under-Typed if it omits load exposure mapping.
* Invalid if it attributes stability to narrative rather than constraint alignment.

Typing discipline must reject claims that elevate narrative over primitives.

---

# 8. Example Schema

Let:

* $x(t)$ = system state
* $r_i(t)$ = resource vectors
* $g_j(x(t))$ = state constraints

Constraint breach:

$$
g_k(x(t)) > 0
$$

Authority Injection response:

* Reinterpret $g_k$ as irrelevant.
* Redefine metric to exclude $g_k$.
* Attribute breach to individual defect rather than structural boundary.

Constraint Realism response:

* Acknowledge breach.
* Update model.
* Adjust trajectory or redesign.

---

# 9. Ontological Hierarchy Preservation

Stack integrity requires:

Execution Primitives
→ Structural Typing
→ Control
→ Cognition
→ Norms
→ Governance
→ Strategy

Authority Injection attempts:

Narrative
→ Governance
→ Norms
→ Control
→ Primitives

This inversion destabilizes the stack.

---

# 10. Summary

Authority Injection is a governance-layer corruption pattern in which:

* Narrative is treated as upstream of constraint.
* Authority is detached from load.
* Primitives are symbolically overridden.
* Failure is reframed rather than modeled.

Constraint Realism maintains:

* Primitives are invariant.
* Authority is downstream.
* Narrative is interpretive.
* Consequence propagation is non-negotiable.

Stack coherence requires preserving this ontological ordering.
