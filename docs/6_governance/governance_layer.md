# Governance Layer  
## Authority, Interface Contracts, and Stack-Level Redesign

---

## Status

This document defines the **Governance Layer** of the stack.

It assumes:

- `execution_primitives.md`
- `typing_discipline.md`
- `2_control/control_layer.md`
- `3_cognitive/cognitive_layer.md`
- `4_domain/*`
- `5_normative/normative_layer.md`

Governance does **not** redefine physics.  
It does **not** directly optimize behavior.  
It does **not** choose goals.

It defines:

> Who has authority to modify constraints,  
> how layers interact through contracts,  
> and how redesign propagates across the stack.

If:

- Execution makes action real,
- Control stabilizes it,
- Cognition chooses under infinity,
- Domains instantiate structure,
- Norms restrict admissibility,

then Governance determines:

> How the system modifies itself without collapsing.

---

# 1. Scope

The Governance Layer applies when:

- multiple agents or subsystems interact,
- authority over constraint-setting exists,
- enforcement mechanisms operate,
- redesign decisions affect shared load,
- versioning across layers must be coordinated.

It is not about leadership charisma.

It is about:

> Constraint authority and interface integrity.

---

# 2. Governance as Meta-Constraint Management

Governance operates on:

- closures,
- metrics,
- normative sets,
- redesign triggers,
- boundary declarations.

It answers:

- Who may modify constraints?
- Under what conditions?
- With what load exposure?
- With what rollback cost?

Governance is:

> Constraint over constraints.

---

# 3. Authority Typing

Authority is well-typed only when:

- the actor has control over relevant degrees of freedom,
- the actor bears proportional load exposure,
- the decision boundary is decidable,
- enforcement topology is declared,
- horizon scope is explicit.

Authority without load exposure is structurally unstable.

---

# 4. Interface Contracts Between Layers

Each layer must expose:

- admissible inputs,
- guaranteed outputs,
- failure semantics,
- version identifiers.

Contracts prevent:

- normative leakage into physics,
- cognitive speculation masquerading as control,
- domain assumptions contaminating core primitives.

Governance ensures:

> Interface contracts remain stable across drift.

---

# 5. Stack Integrity Rules

Governance must preserve:

1. Execution core invariants.
2. Viability precedence.
3. Redesign possibility.
4. Refusal symmetry.
5. Load traceability.

No governance decision may:

- erase topology,
- remove refusal paths,
- suppress failure visibility,
- collapse redesign authority silently.

If it does, it becomes illegitimate.

---

# 6. Versioning and Regime Shifts

Every layer must be versionable.

Versioning includes:

- explicit horizon declaration,
- migration cost,
- backward compatibility constraints,
- sunset conditions.

Governance coordinates:

- when to migrate,
- when to freeze,
- when to fork,
- when to deprecate.

Unversioned governance produces silent brittleness.

---

# 7. Redesign Authority

Redesign authority must be:

- explicitly allocated,
- load-bearing,
- revocable,
- constrained by horizon.

Redesign authority without:

- feedback channels,
- transparency,
- load exposure,

degenerates into arbitrary power.

Redesign authority without enforcement degenerates into narrative.

---

# 8. Enforcement and Legitimacy

Governance requires enforcement mechanisms.

Enforcement must:

- map to topology,
- declare cost,
- be predictable,
- respect horizon bounds.

Legitimacy arises when:

- enforcement aligns with declared norms,
- load distribution is visible,
- authority is substitutable,
- refusal symmetry is preserved where promised.

Legitimacy collapses when:

- enforcement is asymmetric,
- horizons are silently shifted,
- narrative substitutes for contract.

# 9. Governance Failure Modes

## 9.1 Authority Without Exposure

Leads to:
- hidden load routing,
- moral hazard,
- fragility under stress.

---

## 9.2 Metric Capture

Governance optimizes for metrics that no longer track viability.

Results:
- performance illusions,
- collapse under drift.

---

## 9.3 Frozen Redesign

Excessive closure prevents adaptation.

Leads to:
- rigidity,
- catastrophic failure at regime shift.

---

## 9.4 Permanent Exploration

Refusal to close degrees of freedom when load-bearing.

Leads to:
- coordination breakdown,
- systemic inefficiency,
- diffuse responsibility.

---

# 10. Governance in Robotics

In robotics systems (ROS/ROS2 contexts):

Governance includes:

- safety certification authority,
- version compatibility policy,
- hardware interface contracts,
- fail-safe standards,
- control envelope enforcement.

Authority must align with:

- load location,
- physical consequence topology,
- redesign feasibility.

A software team without hardware exposure must not unilaterally redefine safety invariants.

---

# 11. Governance in Personal Domain

Personal governance includes:

- self-imposed constraints,
- identity commitments,
- refusal rules,
- long-horizon design decisions.

Questions include:

- Who inside the agent has redesign authority?
- Are impulses allowed to override long-horizon norms?
- Is refusal symmetry preserved under stress?
- Are goals versioned or frozen?

Self-governance failure manifests as:

- drift without recognition,
- narrative rationalization,
- hidden load accumulation (health, reputation, trust).

---

# 12. Governance and Power

Power is:

> The capacity to reassign disturbance across nodes and horizons.

Governance determines:

- whether this reassignment is legitimate,
- whether load-bearing is acknowledged,
- whether buffers are transparent.

Unchecked power violates stack integrity.
Zero power eliminates coordination.

Governance balances exposure and authority.

---

# 13. Meta-Governance (Stack-Level Redesign)

Meta-governance governs:

- the modification of the governance layer itself.

This includes:

- constitutional revision,
- architecture refactoring,
- core reinterpretation.

Meta-governance must respect:

- execution primitives,
- horizon constraints,
- topology,
- viability precedence.

No meta-layer may erase physics.

---

# 14. Separation from Normative Layer

Norms define what is permitted.
Governance defines who enforces and modifies those permissions.

Norms without governance:
- remain narrative.

Governance without norms:
- becomes arbitrary force.

---

# 15. Governance Is Not Morality

Governance is structural.

It does not determine:

- what is good,
- what is virtuous,
- what is desirable.

It determines:

- how constraint changes are authorized,
- how layers remain coherent,
- how redesign occurs without collapse.

---

# Summary

The Governance Layer:

- allocates authority over constraints,
- maintains interface contracts,
- preserves stack integrity,
- coordinates versioning,
- ensures redesign safety,
- binds enforcement to topology.

It sits above norms,
but below nothing.

It cannot override execution primitives.
It cannot eliminate drift.
It cannot abolish irreversibility.

It can only decide:

> How the system adapts without lying to itself.
