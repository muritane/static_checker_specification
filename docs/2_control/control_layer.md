# Control Layer  
## Stability, Regulation, and Intervention Under Bounded Execution

---

## Status

This document defines the **Control Layer** of the stack.

It assumes:

- `execution_primitives.md`
- `typing_discipline.md`

It does **not** introduce new physics.
It does **not** introduce values.

It specifies how systems:

- regulate themselves,
- intervene in trajectories,
- maintain stability,
- manage disturbance,
- allocate corrective effort,

under bounded resources, drift, and irreversible abstraction.

If the Execution Layer answers:
> What must be true for systems to run?

and the Typing Layer answers:
> When are claims about execution well-formed?

the Control Layer answers:
> How can a system remain stable and viable under disturbance and drift?

---

# 1. Scope

This layer applies when:

- state transitions are ongoing,
- disturbance propagates,
- viability must be preserved,
- and regulation is required.

It includes:

- feedback systems,
- governance loops,
- adaptive agents,
- robotic control stacks,
- organizational control mechanisms,
- institutional correction processes.

It does not assume intelligence.
It does not assume morality.
It does not assume optimization.

It assumes only that:
> The system must keep running.

---

# 2. Control as Constraint Enforcement

Control is the structured process by which a system:

- senses deviation,
- compares against constraints,
- injects corrective action,
- and reallocates resources to maintain viability.

Control is not optimization.
Control is viability preservation under disturbance.

---

# 3. Structural Components of Control

Every control regime contains:

## 3.1 Sensing

- Measurement of state variables.
- Imperfect and resource-bounded.
- Subject to latency and noise.
- Dependent on abstraction and compression (E4).

Control cannot exceed sensing fidelity.

---

## 3.2 Model

- A compressed representation of causal structure (E4).
- Horizon-bounded (E6).
- Drift-sensitive (E5).

Model mismatch is inevitable.
Control must tolerate misalignment.

---

## 3.3 Policy

- Mapping from sensed state to intervention.
- Consumes resources (E1).
- Collapses alternatives (E3).

Policies trade flexibility for responsiveness.

---

## 3.4 Actuation

- Injects disturbance into topology (E7, E8).
- Consumes finite resources (E1).
- Irreversibly commits transitions (E3).

Control action is itself execution.

---

## 3.5 Feedback Loop

- Links sensing → model → policy → actuation → updated state.
- Bounded by latency.
- Limited by bandwidth.
- Sensitive to drift.

Control stability is limited by loop delay and resource margin.

---

# 4. Stability Under Drift

Because drift is structural (E5), stability cannot mean:

- permanent equilibrium,
- invariant invariants,
- static correctness.

Stability means:

> Viability is preserved within a declared horizon under bounded disturbance.

Control must therefore manage:

- disturbance magnitude,
- disturbance frequency,
- buffer capacity,
- model degradation.

---

# 5. Buffers and Slack

Buffers include:

- energy reserves,
- time margins,
- redundancy,
- spare capacity,
- coordination tolerance.

Buffers:

- delay consequence propagation (E8),
- absorb disturbance,
- reduce control gain requirements.

But buffers:

- are finite (E1),
- hide accumulating error,
- create latency in failure detection.

No buffer eliminates cost.
It redistributes it over time.

---

# 6. Control Regimes

Control regimes differ in aggressiveness and structure.

## 6.1 Reactive Control

- Acts after deviation is observed.
- Lower modeling cost.
- Higher latency.
- More disturbance accumulation.

---

## 6.2 Predictive Control

- Uses model to anticipate deviation.
- Higher modeling cost.
- Lower steady-state disturbance.
- More brittle under drift.

---

## 6.3 Adaptive Control

- Updates model during execution.
- Consumes redesign bandwidth.
- Competes with exploitation.
- Requires preserved redesign pathways (Typing Layer §10).

---

## 6.4 Structural Redesign

- Changes topology or constraints.
- Not merely adjusting policy.
- High cost.
- Horizon-expanding.

Redesign belongs at boundary between Control and Governance layers.

---

# 7. Control and Viability

Control is subordinate to viability (Execution E9).

If control policy:

- preserves short-term metrics,
- but collapses long-horizon viability,

it is structurally invalid.

Control must be evaluated relative to declared horizon (E6).

---

# 8. Control Cost

Control is not free.

It consumes:

- sensing bandwidth,
- computation,
- actuation energy,
- coordination capacity,
- buffer margin.

Over-control can destabilize systems by:

- amplifying noise,
- increasing latency,
- exhausting resources,
- suppressing redesign signals.

Under-control allows:

- drift accumulation,
- buffer saturation,
- catastrophic transitions.

Control is a constrained balancing act.

---

# 9. Control Failure Modes

Common structural failures include:

## 9.1 Latency Overshoot

Correction arrives too late due to:

- long feedback loops,
- slow sensing,
- delayed consequence visibility.

---

## 9.2 Model Drift

Model no longer matches environment.
Correction pushes in wrong direction.

---

## 9.3 Hidden Buffer Saturation

Buffers absorb disturbance silently.
Failure appears sudden.

---

## 9.4 Control Oscillation

Overcorrection amplifies noise.
Stability margin collapses.

---

## 9.5 Viability-Blind Optimization

Control optimizes local metric
while eroding global survival margin.

---

# 10. Control and Topology

Control action changes load routing.

Intervention:

- redistributes disturbance,
- reassigns buffer ownership,
- shifts burden across nodes.

Control without topology awareness:

- misattributes responsibility,
- hides cost,
- induces power asymmetry.

Topology awareness is mandatory for governance.

---

# 11. Control vs Optimization

Optimization:

- improves performance along declared metric.

Control:

- preserves viability under disturbance.

Optimization without control is brittle.
Control without optimization is conservative.

The stack requires:

Viability → Control → Optimization  
(not the reverse).

---

# 12. Control Layer Boundaries

This layer does not decide:

- goals,
- legitimacy,
- value,
- authority.

It answers:

> Given a goal and bounded execution, how can stability be maintained?

Goal selection belongs above.
Execution physics belongs below.

---

# 13. Minimal Structural Invariants

For control to remain coherent:

- Horizons must be declared (E6).
- Topology must be representable (E7).
- Buffers must be traceable (E8).
- Drift must be acknowledged (E5).
- Redesign path must exist (Typing Layer §10).

If these collapse, control degenerates into narrative reassurance.

---

# 14. Relation to Robotics (Example Mapping)

In robotics systems:

- Sensing → sensor fusion
- Model → world model / state estimator
- Policy → planner / controller
- Actuation → motor commands
- Buffer → battery, thermal margin, computational headroom
- Drift → terrain change, wear, latency shifts
- Redesign → firmware update, architecture change

The same structure holds for institutions and personal systems.

---

# Summary

Control is:

- structured intervention under bounded resources,
- viability-preserving regulation under drift,
- disturbance management through topology,
- and resource-aware corrective action.

It does not remove irreversibility.
It does not eliminate drift.
It does not create infinite slack.

It keeps systems running — temporarily and conditionally —  
within declared horizons.

Optimization and governance sit above it.
Physics remains below it.
